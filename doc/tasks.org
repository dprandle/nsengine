* TODO Create method for joining multiple transform instances together in to a single mesh
  - This would take a world space vec3 as the meshes center
  - All transform instances would be required to have a render component with at least one material and a valid submesh associated with that material
  - Any submeshes in any of the instances with the same material would be appended to the existing submesh which would require each indice to have the existing submesh's vertice count added to it
  - All instances would need to be de-childed and/or de-parented within the scene before this operation
  - Should have option to create a new mesh out of several instances within the scene that does not require these instances to change in any way


* TODO Add free_type library and implmement font/rendering mechanics based on that

* TODO Get Mac build working

* TODO Remove gl reference from material - create translation function

* TODO Create scripting system using either chai script or javascript

* TODO Add ui_handle_component - when dragged it will move the anchors of the root rect_tform along with the mouse in screen coords

* TODO Finish sprite comp which will allow you to set up a sprite and it's animations using multiple materials which will probably all reference a single sprite sheet - should be able to create new named animation sets, each full of normalized key frames, and an animation time, along with controls for starting the animation, stopping it, and looping it or playing it once.
