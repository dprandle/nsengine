* Notes

I am moving the opengl specific code in to nsopengl_driver.

This will register resources and will assign the needed opengl resources so that those resources can be rendered later. This will be accomplished with add/remove/create/destroy resource events. Most likely they should be on create and destroy events - or possibly even in the resource's constructor/destructor to make sure that gl resources are assigned.

A pointer to the resource can be used as the resource's identifier - this can get the resource's type and owning plugin id. Something like that.

In the event of a name change - the driver doesn't care because its using the resource's memory address to store the needed gpu memory. If the resource is deleted, a resource deleted event needs to be propagated to the render system.
